# Hotel Lorem Ipson

That's a weekend project for a WEB DEVELOPMENT CLASS. The challenge was use the PHP that is not my strong language.
Dispite that, it was fun to try something outside of my confort-zone and I definitly know more about SLQ now.

## Getting Started

Thats not that hard to set it up. A normal apache/mysql local server must be used and the "trabalho.sql" must be imported on a database with the same name (trabalho).

### Prerequisites

Localy you will need to have a apache and msql server runing. I use a normal Xaamp server, you can download here:

```
